# Resources / Study Materials 

I am using a book called Exam Cram Comptia A+ core 1 and core 2.
This book is actually the book we use for my college classes.
Technically speaking, I have started studying since January 2023 bu it's hard for me contain the knowledge.

Now that I am essentially studying from the top, it's like a review, so some topics are already familiar but not like...contained inn my head. /
It's like trying to remember the answer for a test question, you know you have read it somewhere in the book but can't remember what it is.



Also following Mike Meyers's comptia a + core 1 and 2 reviews
