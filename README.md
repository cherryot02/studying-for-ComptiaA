# studying for Comptia A+
This repository mainly serves as my notes and documentations as I study for Comptia A+ exams.

Actually, I took core 1 exam on 10 / 27 / 2023, but I failed it. 
Why? Simple, I did not study enough for it.

A few months before the exam, I told myself to schedule an exam date so I can take the studying seriously, that was also what most people suggested.
I was a full-time college student and I also worked part-time. School is already tough for me as technology really is something I have always avoided since I tell myself I am not smart enough for it.\
Weeks leading to that, my classes were kind of geared towards A+ as well but I was too burnt out that I could not spend studying for core 1 specifically and instead play Genshin ahaha. \

and so the day arrived and I failed the test. I scored arounf 649 (barely passed ahhaha) and passing score was 675...dang, that was 26 points difference but it doesnt matter because I mostly guessed and used my gut feeling--WHICH IS NOT GOOD by the way. \ 

Gave myself some pep talk. I have to get a good job, good pay, good life. So I have to endure it and really put effort.

So now, I am dedicating this whole repository for studying and also something I will look back on as reference.


As of the time I am making this I have not scheduled any exam dates for the retake. 

Please watch me, a non-tech person, go through this difficult(for me, I was an art student) journey of pursuing a career in cyber sec, or tech in general.
First month of 2024 baby! Lesgo! Year of the dragon!!!!!!!
